// Example: 12345.6789 -> { units = 12345, nanos = 678900000 }
message DecimalValue {

    // Whole units part of the amount
    int64 units = 1;

    // Nano units of the amount (10^-9)
    // Must be same sign as units
    sfixed32 nanos = 2;
}

/*The nanos field represents values from 0.999_999_999 
to -0.999_999_999. For example, the decimal value 1.5m 
would be represented as { units = 1, nanos = 500_000_000 }. 
This is why the nanos field in this example uses the 
sfixed32 type, which encodes more efficiently than 
int32 for larger values. If the units field is 
negative, the nanos field should also be negative.*/
